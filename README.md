## Data Availability

BlogCatalog (BC) is an online community that offers blog services, where each blogger represents a study unit within the dataset. The relationships between these units form the social network, with each edge denoting a social link. The features are bag-of-words representations of keywords in the bloggersâ€™ descriptions.

Flickr is an online social network providing image and video sharing services. The dataset is constructed by forming links between images that share common metadata. In this dataset, each instance is a user, and each edge represents the social relationship between two users. The features of each user represent a list of tags indicating their interests. 

The BlogCatalog and Flickr datasets are available at https://github.com/songjiang0909/Causal-Inference-on-Networked-Data.
